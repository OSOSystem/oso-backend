## Code of conduct
This project and everyone participating in it should obey to the [OSO Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
Please report unacceptable behavior to [contact@ososystem.de](mailto:contact@ososystem.de)

## How can I contribute?
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials, blog posts, improving the documentation, 
submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself.

### Code contribution
Choose an issue you want to do. Write in the comments that you are going to take care of it.
When you are done submit a pull request. 

### Bug reports
Have you seen a :bug: around here? We don't like bugs. :fearful: <br>
But I guess there is no choice...
Let's hunt them down together as good as we can! :hocho:

* Open up a bug issue
* Describe it as good as you can and the following steps it took so others can reproduce it
* Wait for someone to pick the issue up

And let's :pray: that it won't show ever again!

### Feature requests
Is there a feature you wish for which does not exist? No problem, just create a feature issue.
Write down why you think it is useful and describe how it should work.

## Code review process
When a pull request comes in, two of the maintainers have to approve it before it can be merged into the develop branch.
If we notice an issue with a pull request, we will write it down in the comments so you can fix it 
or discuss with us why it shouldn't be done.

We will look at the pull requests on a regular basis.

## Styleguides
### Git commit messages
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
* When updating only the documentation, insert **[ci skip]** into the commit message so the build won't trigger.
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
    * :wrench: `:wrench:` when fixing something
    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
    * :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings
    * :heavy_plus_sign: `:heavy_plus_sign:` when adding a feature

Now you ask yourself why in the heck should I consider using emojis? Fair Question!<br>
I'll answer it with another question. Who does not like emojis? :grin:
